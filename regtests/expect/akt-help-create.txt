akt create: create the keystore

Usage: akt create [--counter-range min:max] [--force] [--gpg USER]

  The create command is used to create the new keystore file.
  By default the PBKDF2 iteration counter is in range 500000..1000000.
  You can change this range by using the `--counter-range` option.
  High values provide best password protection at the expense of speed.
  When the `--gpg` option is used, the keystore is protected by
  using gpg and one of the user's GPG key.
